# Sip-and-Code
Hello everyone,
Welcome to the sip and code project, if you are here we would love your contribution. The project target is to develop a website where we will be registering new members to our group/club and also set up and display events attended and yet to be attended. Users can book and pay for the events through the automated system we will add.

Any contribution and changes you see they are necessary are welcome, we love changes and the exchange of ideas.

This is also a project where we will all learn and see different kinds of development from various individuals. Could you don't mock other's ideas?

Initially wanted to work using MERN technology but any idea to push on the idea is welcome and the system is open. Mongo DB was my preference due it its dynamic nature.

Frontend of the system I am using React(vite) and it's yet to be completed some errors are one so you can help solve them.

# Running the system on your local machine.

You have to have an installed node so that you can learn it locally.

To start the project use 

NPM RUN DEV (frontend) part.
