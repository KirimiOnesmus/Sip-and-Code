# Sip-and-Code
Hello everyone,
Welome to the sip and code project, if you are here we would love your contribution on this project. The project target is to develop a website where we will be registering new member to our group/club and also set up and display events attended and yet to be attended. Users can book and pay for the events through the automated system we will add.

Any contribution and changes you see they are necessary are welcome, we love changes and exchange of ideas.

This is also a project where we will all learn and see different kinds of development from different individuals. Kindly don't mock others ideas.

Intially wanted to work using MERN techonology but any idea to push on the idea is welcome and the system is open. Mongo DB was my preference due it its dynamic nature.

Frontend of the system i am using React(vite) and it's yet to be completed and some errors are one so you can help solve it.

#Runing the system on you local machine.

You have to have installed node so that you can learn it locally.

To start the project use 

NPM RUN DEV (frontend) part.
